# data-structures-csharp

A sandbox repository to test and learn a bit about data structures in C#

***

##### Data Structures

###### SinglyLinkedList

A simple implementation of an internal singly linked list. Includes the ListNode implementation and a LinkedList class that implements the C# ICollection<T> interface. The SinglyLinkedList node only contains a reference to the Next item in the list and the data for this node. 

###### DoublyLinkedList

A simple implementation of an internal singly linked list. Includes the ListNode implementation and a LinkedList class that implements the C# ICollection<T> interface. The DoublyLinkedList node contains a reference to both the Next and Prev items in the list and the data for this node.
