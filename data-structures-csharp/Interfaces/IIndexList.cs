  /// a List class. 
  /// 
  /// The IList interface that I have created also implements the IEnumerable
  /// interface so we can still use these data structures in place of other
  /// C# ones, but that would be very silly, as although I am trying to make
  /// the algorithms are roughly as efficient as possible in terms of the 
  /// overall design, some of the decisions made in the classes will be sub
  /// optimal. 
  /// 
  /// If however you just want to run through the different structures to see
  /// how they work feel free!

  /// These interfaces aren't of any use for a real list class. I am only using
  /// them to make testing easier as I am duplicating a lot of logic for each
  /// different list implementation and they should all behave the same apart 
  /// from for the complexity.
